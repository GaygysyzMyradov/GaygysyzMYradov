### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, I'm Gaýgysyz Myradov!

I am a Senior Computer Science student in Xiamen University Malaysia. Currently, I individually work as a front-end web developer with intermediate skill level on CSS and HTML. I´m based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

My journey to Programming and Coding started back in my secondary school and since then I have been living and breathing coding, well mixture of coding and university courses. Although my GitHub profile is fairly new and empty, I am planning to use it actively and add more repos in the near future as I continue my journey on Web Development. 

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my Front-End development skills, especially Javascript and ReactJS.<br />
