I am a Senior Computer Science student in Xiamen University Malaysia. Currently, I individually work as a front-end web developer with intermediate level of Java, C++, HTML & CSS skills. I am also a private coding Tutor. I´m based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

My journey to Programming and Coding started back in my secondary school and since then I have been living and breathing coding, well mixture of coding and university courses. Although my GitHub profile is fairly new and empty, I am planning to use it as active as possible and add more repos in the near future as I continue my journey on Web Development. 

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

  - Front-End development, especially Javascript and ReactJS.
  - Responsiveness of a Website.
  - Back-End development using PHP.
